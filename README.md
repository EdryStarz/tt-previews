# TT Cover Studio — TikTok Thumbnail Maker

Fast, client‑side thumbnail maker for TikTok (1080×1920). Drop in a face and a context photo (files or URLs), add a title, and export PNG. Everything runs locally in the browser.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1) Create public repo (e.g., `tt-previews`). 
2) Upload `index.html` (this file) to the root. 
3) Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch: main /(root).
4) Live at: `https://<username>.github.io/tt-previews/`

## CORS tip
For URLs, host images in the same repo (e.g., `/assets/face.jpg`) to avoid CORS.
